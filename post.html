    title: "What Is Philosophy — And Why Should You Care?",
    author: "Vaibhav Vijayaraghavan", date: "January 22, 2026", tag: "General", readTime: 4,
    desc: "Philosophy isn't a dusty relic locked in a library. It's the framework behind every career, every decision, every argument you'll ever make.",
    body: `<p>When most people hear the word "philosophy," they picture bearded men arguing in ancient Greek courtyards. They don't picture themselves. They should.</p>
    <p>Philosophy is the discipline of thinking clearly — about ethics, logic, identity, knowledge, and the structure of reality. These aren't abstract puzzles. They're the backbone of medicine, law, finance, computer science, and every other field IndyPhilo cares about.</p>
    <p>A doctor decides whether to recommend an experimental treatment with uncertain outcomes — that's applied ethics. A lawyer constructs an argument that has to hold up under rigorous scrutiny — that's logic. A policy-maker weighs competing goods for a society — that's political philosophy.</p>
    <p>IndyPhilo exists because we believe high schoolers are already doing philosophy. They just don't have the vocabulary or the community to do it well. We want to change that.</p>
    <blockquote>"The unexamined life is not worth living." — Socrates</blockquote>
    <p>This is what we're here for: to examine. To question. To think more carefully than we did yesterday. Welcome to IndyPhilo.</p>`,

    title: "The Ethical Dilemmas Every Doctor Faces",
    author: "Anika Reddy", date: "January 28, 2026", tag: "Medicine", readTime: 5,
    desc: "Medical school teaches you how to heal. Philosophy teaches you how to decide who gets healed, when, and at what cost.",
    body: `<p>Bioethics is one of the most active and urgent branches of applied philosophy. Every hospital in the world grapples with questions that can't be answered by anatomy textbooks alone.</p>
    <p>Should a patient with six months to live be told immediately, or is that decision more complex? Who decides when life support ends? How do we allocate scarce resources — ventilators, organs, vaccines — fairly?</p>
    <p>These are philosophical questions dressed in scrubs. The four principles of bioethics — autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice — were developed by philosophers, not physicians. Medical students learn them as gospel, but rarely trace them back to their roots in moral theory.</p>
    <p>At IndyPhilo, we think understanding those roots matters. Not just for future doctors, but for all of us who will one day be patients, family members, or voters deciding what our healthcare system should look like.</p>`,

    title: "Is Justice Real, or Just a Word We Agree On?",
    author: "Aanya Kalakonda", date: "February 3, 2026", tag: "Law", readTime: 6,
    desc: "The law is built on the concept of justice — but what is justice, exactly? Three philosophers have three very different answers.",
    body: `<p>Plato thought justice meant everyone doing the job they were best suited for. Aristotle said it was proportional — giving people what they deserve based on merit. John Rawls, writing in 1971, said a just society is one you'd choose to live in if you didn't know what position you'd occupy in it.</p>
    <p>These aren't just academic positions. They're the hidden operating systems behind every legal system on earth.</p>
    <p>The American legal system blends all three — merit-based outcomes, a constitution designed with some Rawlsian principles, and a strong strand of procedural justice. When lawyers argue in court, they're implicitly invoking one framework or another, often without realizing it.</p>
    <blockquote>"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." — Martin Luther King Jr.</blockquote>
    <p>Understanding legal philosophy doesn't just help you prepare for law school. It helps you evaluate laws as they're being made, argue more persuasively, and spot when "justice" is being invoked to cover something else entirely.</p>`,

    title: "The Ethics of Money: Do Markets Have Morals?",
    author: "Nandan Ramaswamy", date: "February 10, 2026", tag: "Finance", readTime: 5,
    desc: "Every financial decision you'll ever make has an ethical dimension. Here's why economists and philosophers need to talk more.",
    body: `<p>In 1776, Adam Smith — the father of modern economics — was first and foremost a moral philosopher. His most famous work on the "invisible hand" was written in the context of a broader theory of moral sentiments.</p>
    <p>Somewhere along the way, economics divorced itself from ethics. We got efficient markets, rational actors, and the assumption that self-interest is enough. The 2008 financial crisis was, in part, a failure of that assumption.</p>
    <p>What do we owe each other economically? Is it ethical for individuals to pursue maximum profit at the expense of workers or communities? What's the moral status of debt? These questions matter for anyone who will work in finance — and for anyone who will live in the economy that finance shapes.</p>
    <p>IndyPhilo's finance track isn't about learning to trade. It's about learning to think about what you're trading, and why it matters.</p>`,

    desc: "We're conducting a student-led psychological study that bridges philosophical inquiry with the scientific method.",
    body: `<p>One of IndyPhilo's flagship projects is the Psych Study — a student-designed, student-run experiment that sits at the intersection of philosophy and psychology.</p>
    <p>The core idea: philosophical questions — about identity, free will, moral judgment — can be studied empirically. We want to test philosophical intuitions with real data from real students.</p>
    <p>This isn't just a fun exercise. Work like this, if done rigorously enough, has real publication potential. We're working to make that happen.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in contributing to the design, data collection, or writing of the study, reach out to any officer. No experience required — just curiosity.</p>`,

    title: "Dare to Think: On Intellectual Courage",
    author: "Mehek Saini", date: "January 15, 2026", tag: "General", readTime: 4,
    desc: "The IndyPhilo motto isn't just a tagline. Intellectual courage — the willingness to follow an argument wherever it leads — is the rarest skill you can develop.",
    body: `<p>Immanuel Kant's motto for the Enlightenment was <em>Sapere aude</em> — "dare to know." We've updated it slightly. Dare to think.</p>
    <p>Most people have opinions. Fewer people have reasons for their opinions. Fewer still can hold their reasons up to scrutiny, acknowledge when they're weak, and update accordingly.</p>
    <p>Intellectual courage isn't about being contrarian. It's about following an argument wherever it leads, even when the destination is uncomfortable. It's about sitting with uncertainty rather than grabbing the nearest confident answer.</p>
    <p>This is what we mean by "dare to think." Not bravado. Not performance. Just the quiet, difficult willingness to actually engage — with ideas, with evidence, with people who see the world differently than you do.</p>
    <p>That's what IndyPhilo is for.</p>`,

    body: `<p>IndyPhilo has partnered with the Junior World Affairs Council (JWAC) — and it's a big deal.</p>
    <p>JWAC gives students access to events with some serious people: former government officials, intelligence community veterans, global policy experts. Their programming is civics-focused, education-first, and centered on global leadership.</p>
    <p>As an IndyPhilo member, you'll have access to those events, plus the opportunity to earn a Global Leadership Certificate and participate in service opportunities.</p>
    <p>Philosophy teaches you to think carefully about power, governance, and the structure of society. JWAC gives you a front-row seat to how that actually works. The combination is worth more than either alone.</p>`,

    author: "Vaibhav Vijayaraghavan", date: "February 15, 2026", tag: "Computer Science", readTime: 6,
    desc: "Alan Turing's famous question launched modern AI. But the deepest questions about machine intelligence are still purely philosophical.",
    body: `<p>In 1950, Alan Turing published a paper asking: "Can machines think?" He proposed what we now call the Turing Test — if a machine can converse indistinguishably from a human, should we say it thinks?</p>
    <p>Seventy-five years later, we have machines that can pass that test. And we're still not sure the question has been answered.</p>
    <p>The philosophy of mind asks what consciousness actually is. Is it just information processing? Is there something it's like to be a computer, the way there's something it's like to be you? The "hard problem of consciousness," articulated by philosopher David Chalmers, remains genuinely unsolved.</p>
    <p>These aren't idle puzzles. If AI systems are moral patients — if they can suffer or flourish — that has enormous implications for how we build and deploy them. The people making those decisions right now mostly haven't thought carefully about the philosophy. They probably should have.</p>`,
